# Fixed drivers for Wacom Bamboo, Graphire 4, Intuos 3 and Cintiq 1st gen tablets on macOS 10.15 Catalina

Wacom's drivers for Bamboo, Graphire 4, Intuos 3 and Cintiq 1st gen tablets have bugs in them that
make them no longer work on macOS 10.15 Catalina, and Wacom is no longer updating these drivers. 
Luckily I was able to fix the bugs and get the drivers working again!

- CTE-450, CTE-650 - Bamboo Fun / Bamboo Art Master (2007)
- CTE-460 - Bamboo One Pen
- CTF-430 - Bamboo One

- CTH-470 - Bamboo Capture / Bamboo Pen & Touch / Bamboo Create
- CTH-661 - Bamboo Fun / Bamboo Art Master (2009) / Bamboo Fun Pen and Touch
- CTH-670 - Bamboo Create
- CTL-460, CTL-660 - Bamboo Pen 
- CTL-470 - Bamboo Connect / Bamboo Pen
- CTT-460 - Bamboo Touch
- MTE-450 - Bamboo

My fixed Graphire 4 driver (v5.3.0-3) supports these tablets:
- CTE-440, CTE-640 - Graphire 4

My fixed Intuos and Cintiq driver (v6.3.15-3) supports these tablets:

## Install the fixed driver

First, download the correct driver for your tablet:

- [Fixed driver v5.3.0-3 for Graphire 4](https://github.com/thenickdude/wacom-driver-fix/releases/download/patch-6/Install-Wacom-Tablet-5.3.0-3-patched.pkg)
- [Fixed driver v5.3.7-6 for Bamboo](https://github.com/thenickdude/wacom-driver-fix/releases/download/patch-6/Install-Wacom-Tablet-5.3.7-6-patched.pkg)
- [Fixed driver v6.3.15-13 for Intuos 3 and Cintiq](https://github.com/thenickdude/wacom-driver-fix/releases/download/patch-6/Install-Wacom-Tablet-6.3.15-3-patched.pkg)

Run the installer to install the driver.

Now we need to remove the permissions that were leftover from the old driver: 

- Click the Apple menu, then System Preferences, Security and Privacy
- On the Privacy tab, select Accessibility and click the lock in the bottom left to make changes. You'll be asked to enter your login credentials.
- Select any Wacom items in the list (PenTabletDriver, ConsumerTouchDriver, WacomTabletSpringboard, etc) and click the "-" button to remove them.
- Do the same on the "Input Monitoring" page 
- Restart the computer

Now we can add permissions for the new fixed driver:

- Touch the pen tip to the tablet once
- Click the Apple menu, then System Preferences, Security and Privacy
- On the Privacy tab, select Accessibility and click the lock in the bottom left to make changes. You'll be asked to enter your login credentials.
- Make sure any Wacom items in the list (PenTabletDriver, ConsumerTouchDriver, WacomTabletSpringboard, etc) are ticked
- Do the same on the "Input Monitoring" page

Your tablet should now be working! You may need to restart the computer one more time.
